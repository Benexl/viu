## Installation

Viu runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android (via Termux). Pre-built binaries are available for quick installation without Python, or you can install via Python 3.10+ package managers.

### Prerequisites

For the best experience, please install these external tools:

- **Required for Streaming:**
  - [**mpv**](https://mpv.io/installation/) - The primary and recommended media player.
- **Recommended for UI & Previews:**
  - [**fzf**](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) - For the best fuzzy-finder interface.
  - [**chafa**](https://github.com/hpjansson/chafa) or [**kitty's icat**](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/kittens/icat/) - For image previews in the terminal.
- **Recommended for Downloads & Advanced Features:**
  - [**ffmpeg**](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) - Required for downloading HLS streams and merging subtitles.
  - [**webtorrent-cli**](https://github.com/webtorrent/webtorrent-cli) - For streaming torrents directly.

### Pre-built Binaries (Recommended for Quick Start)

The easiest way to get started is to download a pre-built, self-contained binary from the [**releases page**](https://github.com/viu-media/viu/releases/latest). These binaries include all dependencies and **do not require Python** to be installed.

**Available for:**

- **Linux** (x86_64): `viu-linux-x86_64`
- **Windows** (x86_64): `viu-windows-x86_64.exe`
- **macOS** (Intel x86_64): `viu-macos-x86_64`
- **macOS** (Apple Silicon ARM64): `viu-macos-arm64`

**Installation Steps:**

1. Download the appropriate binary for your platform from the [**releases page**](https://github.com/viu-media/viu/releases/latest).
2. **Linux/macOS:** Make it executable:

    ```bash
    # Replace with the actual binary name you downloaded
    chmod +x viu-linux-x86_64
    ```

    Then move it to a directory in your PATH:

    ```bash
    # Option 1: System-wide installation (requires sudo)
    sudo mv viu-linux-x86_64 /usr/local/bin/viu

    # Option 2: User directory installation
    mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
    mv viu-linux-x86_64 ~/.local/bin/viu
    # Make sure ~/.local/bin is in your PATH
    ```

    **Windows:** Simply rename `viu-windows-x86_64.exe` to `viu.exe` and place it in a directory in your PATH, or run it directly.

3. Verify the installation:

    ```bash
    viu --version
    ```

### Recommended Installation (uv)

The best way to install Viu is with [**uv**](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), a lightning-fast Python package manager.

```bash
# Install with all optional features for the full experience
uv tool install "viu-media[standard]"

# Or, pick and choose the extras you need:
uv tool install viu-media  # Core functionality only
uv tool install "viu-media[download]"  # For advanced downloading with yt-dlp
uv tool install "viu-media[discord]"   # For Discord Rich Presence
uv tool install "viu-media[notifications]" # For desktop notifications
```

### Other Installation Methods

<details>
  <summary><b>Platform-Specific and Alternative Installers</b></summary>
  
#### Nix / NixOS

##### Ephemeral / One-Off Run (No Installation)

  ```bash
  nix run github:viu-media/viu
  ```

##### Imperative Installation

  ```bash
  nix profile install github:viu-media/viu
  ```

##### Declarative Installation

###### in your flake.nix

  ```

#### Arch Linux (AUR)

Use an AUR helper like `yay` or `paru`.

```bash
# Stable version (recommended)
yay -S viu-media

# Git version (latest commit)
yay -S viu-media-git
```

#### Termux

You may have to have rust installed see this issue: <https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-core/issues/1012#issuecomment-2511269688>.

```bash
# Recommended (with pip due to more control)
pkg install python
pkg install rust # required cause of pydantic

# NOTE: order matters

# get pydantic from the termux user repository
pip install pydantic --extra-index-url https://termux-user-repository.github.io/pypi/

# the above will take a while if you want to see more output and feel like sth is happening lol
pip install pydantic --extra-index-url https://termux-user-repository.github.io/pypi/ -v

# now you can install viu
pip install viu-media

# === optional deps ===
# if you have reach here awesome lol :)

# yt-dlp for downloading m3u8 and hls streams
pip install yt-dlp[default,curl-cffi]

# you may also need ffmpeg for processing the videos
pkg install ffmpeg

# tip if you also want yt functionality
pip install yt-dlp-ejs

# you require js runtime
# eg the recommended one
pkg install deno

# for faster fuzzy search
pip install thefuzz

# if you want faster scraping, though barely noticeable lol
pip install lxml --extra-index-url https://termux-user-repository.github.io/pypi/

# if compilation fails you need to have
pkg install libxml2 libxslt

# == ui setup ==
pkg install fzf

# then enable fzf in the config
viu --selector fzf config --update

# if you want previews as well specify preview option
# though images arent that pretty lol, so you can stick to text over full
viu --preview text config --update

# if you set preview to full you need a terminal image renderer
pkg install chafa

# == player setup ==
# for this you need to strictly install from playstore
# search for mpv or vlc (recommended, since has nicer ui)
# the only limitation is currently its not possible to pass headers to the android players
# through android intents
# so use servers like sharepoint and wixmp
# though this is not an issue when it comes to downloading ;)
# if you have installed using 'pkg' uninstall it

# okey now you are all set, i promise the hussle is worth it lol :)
# posted a video of it working to motivate you
# note i recorded it from waydroid which is android for linux sought of like an emulator(bluestacks for example)
```

## Getting Started: Quick Start

Get up and running in three simple steps:

1. **Authenticate with AniList:**

    ```bash
    viu anilist auth
    ```

    This will open your browser. Authorize the app and paste the obtained token back into the terminal. Alternatively, you can pass the token directly as an argument, or provide a path to a text file containing the token.

2. **Launch the Interactive TUI:**

    ```bash
    viu anilist
    ```

3. **Browse & Play:** Use your arrow keys to navigate the menus, select an anime, and choose an episode to stream instantly.

## Usage Guide

### The Interactive TUI (`viu anilist`)

This is the main, user-friendly way to use Viu. It provides a rich terminal experience where you can:

- Browse trending, popular, and seasonal anime.
- Manage your personal lists (Watching, Completed, Paused, etc.).
- Search for any anime in the AniList database.
- View detailed information, characters, recommendations, reviews, and airing schedules.
- Stream or download episodes directly from the menus.

### Powerful Searching (`viu anilist search`)

Filter the entire AniList database with powerful command-line flags.

```bash
# Search for anime from 2024, sorted by popularity, that is releasing and not on your list
viu anilist search -y 2024 -s POPULARITY_DESC --status RELEASING --not-on-list

# Find the most popular movies with the "Fantasy" genre
viu anilist search -g Fantasy -f MOVIE -s POPULARITY_DESC

# Dump search results as JSON instead of launching the TUI
viu anilist search -t "Demon Slayer" --dump-json
```

### Background Downloads (`viu queue` & `worker`)

Viu includes a robust background downloading system.

1. **Add episodes to the queue:**

    ```bash
    # Add episodes 1-12 of Jujutsu Kaisen to the download queue
    viu queue add -t "Jujutsu Kaisen" -r "0:12"
    ```

2. **Start the worker process:**

    ````bash
    # Run the worker in the foreground (press Ctrl+C to stop)
    viu worker

    # Or run it as a background process
    viu worker &
    ```The worker will now process the queue, download your episodes, and check for notifications.
    ````

### Scriptable Commands (`download` & `search`)

These commands are designed for automation and quick, non-interactive tasks.

#### `download` Examples

```bash
# Download the latest 5 episodes of One Piece
viu download -t "One Piece" -r "-5"

# Download episodes 1 to 24, merge subtitles, and clean up original files
viu download -t "Jujutsu Kaisen" -r "0:24" --merge --clean
```

#### `search` (Binging) Examples

```bash
# Start binging an anime from the first episode
viu search -t "Attack on Titan" -r ":"

# Watch the latest episode directly
viu search -t "My Hero Academia" -r "-1"
```

### Local Data Management (`viu registry`)

Viu maintains a local database of your anime for offline access and enhanced performance.

- `registry sync`: Synchronize your local data with your remote AniList account.
- `registry stats`: Show detailed statistics about your viewing habits.
- `registry backup`: Create a compressed backup of your entire registry.
- `registry restore`: Restore your data from a backup file.
- `registry export/import`: Export/import your data to JSON/CSV for use in other applications.
- `registry clean`: Clean up orphaned or invalid entries from your local database.

## Configuration

Viu is highly customizable. A default configuration file with detailed comments is created on the first run.

- **Find your config file:** `viu config --path`
- **Edit in your default editor:** `viu config`
- **Use the interactive wizard:** `viu config --interactive`

Most settings in the config file can be temporarily overridden with command-line flags (e.g., `viu --provider animepahe anilist`).

<details>
  <summary><b>Default Configuration (`config.ini`) Explained</b></summary>

```ini
# [general] Section: Controls overall application behavior.
[general]
provider = allanime          ; The default anime provider (allanime, animepahe).
selector = fzf               ; The interactive UI tool (fzf, rofi, default).
preview = full               ; Preview type in selectors (full, text, image, none).
image_renderer = icat        ; Tool for terminal image previews (icat, chafa).
icons = True                 ; Display emoji icons in the UI.
auto_select_anime_result = True ; Automatically select the best search match.
...

# [stream] Section: Controls playback and streaming.
[stream]
player = mpv                 ; The media player to use (mpv, vlc).
quality = 1080               ; Preferred stream quality (1080, 720, 480, 360).
translation_type = sub       ; Preferred audio/subtitle type (sub, dub).
auto_next = False            ; Automatically play the next episode.

download_check_interval = 5      ; How often to process the download queue (minutes).
...
```

</details>

## Advanced Features

### MPV IPC Integration

When `use_ipc = True` is set in your config, Viu provides powerful in-player controls without needing to close MPV.

**Key Bindings:**

- `Shift+N`: Play the next episode.
- `Shift+P`: Play the previous episode.
- `Shift+R`: Reload the current episode.
- `Shift+A`: Toggle auto-play for the next episode.
- `Shift+T`: Toggle between `dub` and `sub`.

**Script Messages (For MPV Console):**

- `script-message select-episode <number>`: Jump to a specific episode.
- `script-message select-server <name>`: Switch to a different streaming server.

### Running as a Service (Linux/systemd)

You can run the background worker as a systemd service for persistence.

1. Create a service file at `~/.config/systemd/user/viu-worker.service`:

    ```ini
    [Unit]
    Description=Viu Background Worker
    After=network-online.target

    [Service]
    Type=simple
    ExecStart=/path/to/your/viu worker --log
    Restart=always
    RestartSec=30

    [Install]
    WantedBy=default.target
    ```

    *Replace `/path/to/your/viu` with the output of `which viu`.*

2. Enable and start the service:

    ```bash
    systemctl --user daemon-reload
    systemctl --user enable --now viu-worker.service
    ```
